Introduction:
--------------
JOS  is  invented   in  JDollar  by  wilmix  jemin  j  at 2015  and  is  used    only   for the    construction   of  Operating  Systems
Using    JOS   One  can create   an  OS   with  in  5  or 10 or  30 minutes. JOS    takes   only  .OS  Extension
file  and  converts  to  byte code  completly and  JDollar  class file.
So  that   we  can   call   JDollar class file 
JOS  follow   MVC   for   OS  Design.
But   View   will   be  Jdollar.

It  is   ranked  as NO:9 Advanced Technology.  


SYNTAX for  controller:
---------------------

<JOS>

@Pack

<! 

/*  call   Model  class  with  methods */

/*  
Add  such   GUI  things  in  ArrayList.
Pass  the  ArrayList   object  needed  like
JHOME Design  or  Double  Buffer Deign  to  WCONSOLE  method...

ie ,WCONSOLE.method(arraylist); */

/* Add   Login  condition  */

!>

</JOS>


Syntax  for  Model  in WCONSOLE Program: 
---------------------------------------

<JOS>

@Pack

<Method>

public  static   void   method(ArrayList  ar)  throws  Exception

{

/*  Use    for   loop  with   conditions

and call  Console  or  double  buffer  class  based  on  the

ArrayList   VAlue  */

/*  Add  GUI  if  necessary  */

</JOS>


Output:
-------
This   will   display  a   GUI  like  JHome,
SLIDE, DoubleBuffer  ,etc  as   we  seen
in Cheetak  OS  with  in   5  or  10  minutes..
since  it  uses  only  built in  class
and  methods  for  JOS  design.


Advantages:
-----------
1)  Saves more  time  and  Cost
2)  Less  code  results  in   readability  for  OS  Developer or user.
3)  Used   also  in Cloud  OS  design.
4)  It  is  more   USerfriendly  MVC Design.
5)  We  can  create  your  own  GUI   for
os  design  and  add  it  in  Model.
6)  This   will  be   more  useful    to  deliver  a  Product   with  in  few hours.
7)  JDollar  is  a  High  level  langauage  can   used  to  convert  a  code  to  object  file.
